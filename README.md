# QGL_toolkit

A C++ library for 3D OpengL viewer with Qt.

This code is based on the [LibQGLViewer](http://libqglviewer.com/) library, which provides a 3D viewer with many functionalities as an extension of QOpenGLWidget.

QGL_toolkit is a simplified version of LibQGLViewer, with a reduced set of essential features, re-implemented as a small header-only library.
Provided with a minimalist demo that shows how to create your own viewer and use it in a Qt window.
